## What?

1. You give it an URL
2. It downloads HTML
3. Extracts readable part (like reader mode does in your browser)
4. Converts into markdown
5. Nicely displays it inside TUI
6. ...
7. PROFIT!!!

## TODO

- Bookmarks (like your cool browser does)
- Caching (do not download the same page twice)
- Configuration (e.g. set you own reading speed in words per minute for your personal reading time estimation)
